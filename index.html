    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Jared</strong>, a second-year Computer Science student at QUT (Queensland University of Technology). I have a deep passion for technology, programming, and problem-solving, and I'm constantly looking for opportunities to expand my skills in software development, web development, and IT.</p>
    <p>As part of my studies, I've gained experience with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Java, JavaScript, Python, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, and React. I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems, and Iâ€™m particularly interested in web development, where I can create dynamic, interactive user experiences.</p>
    <p>Beyond coding, I'm always exploring the latest trends in technology and how they can be applied to improve systems and create more efficient solutions. I'm eager to collaborate with others, learn from the community, and make meaningful contributions to the field of technology.</p>
